#    Details about common password attacks
#       1. Brute-Force Attacks  
#           A brute-force attack is a trial-and-error method used by malicious actors to guess login information, encryption keys, or find hidden web pages. 
#           It involves systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct one is found.
#    
#        *  Online Brute Force: Attempts are made directly against a live login system (e.g., a website login page, SSH server, RDP). 
#                                These are often slower due to network latency and server-side defenses (like rate limiting and account lockouts).
#
#        *  Offline Brute Force: Attackers obtain a list of hashed passwords (e.g., from a data breach) and then attemp to crack them offline.
#                                 This is much faster because there are no server-side delays or lockout mechanisms. 
#       2. Dictionary Attacks
#            A dictionary attack is a refined form of a brute-force attack that uses a predefined list of words, phrases,
#            and common passwords (a "dictionary" or "wordlist") instead of trying every random character combination.
#             
#          *  Automated Testing: Similar to brute-force attacks, automated tools cycle through the curated list, attempting each entry as a password.
#          *  Efficiency: Dictionary attacks are generally faster and less computationally intensive than full brute-force attacks because they attemp only the most likely combinations first.
#              They succeed where users have chosen weak or predictable passwords.
#    
#       Relationship Between Brute Force and Dictionary Attacks
#             > A dictionary attack is a type of brute-force attack because it still uses a trial-and-error approach. 
#             > However, it is  a targeted brute-force attack that narrows the search space significantly by leveraging human predictability.
#             > Attackers often start with a dictionary attack because it is  faster and less resource-intensive.
#             > If that fails, they might then resort to a more exhaustive brute-force attack or a hybrid attack.
