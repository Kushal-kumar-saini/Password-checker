#    Details about common password attacks :-
#       1. Brute-Force Attacks:-
#           A brute-force attack is a trial-and-error method used by malicious actors to guess login information, encryption keys, or find hidden web pages. 
#           It involves systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct one is found.
#    
#        *  Online Brute Force:- Attempts are made directly against a live login system (e.g., a website login page, SSH server, RDP). 
#                                These are often slower due to network latency and server-side defenses (like rate limiting and account lockouts).
#
#        *  Offline Brute Force:- Attackers obtain a list of hashed passwords (e.g., from a data breach) and then attemp to crack them offline.
#                                 This is much faster because there are no server-side delays or lockout mechanisms.

#       2. Dictionary Attacks:-
#            A dictionary attack is a refined form of a brute-force attack that uses a predefined list of words, phrases,
#            and common passwords (a "dictionary" or "wordlist") instead of trying every random character combination.

#       3. Credential Stuffing:-
#            This attack leverages data breaches from one website to compromise accounts on other websites.
#            Attackers take lists of stolen username/password pairs from a breach and automatically try those exact combinations on different popular services (like email providers, social media, banking sites).

#       4. Phishing:-
#              This is a social engineering attack where the attacker tricks the victim into voluntarily giving up their credentials.
#              They do this by impersonating a trustworthy entity (e.g., a bank, a popular online service, a colleague) through fake emails, text messages, or websites.
#              The victim believes they are logging into a legitimate site and enters their credentials, which are then captured by the attacker.

#       5. Keylogging:-
#               This involves installing malicious software (a "keylogger") on a victim's computer or device. 
#               The keylogger records every keystroke made by the user, including usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive information.

#       6. Rainbow Table Attacks (less common against modern, properly stored passwords):-
#                These are precomputed tables that store hashes of potential passwords. 
#                If an attacker obtains a list of hashed passwords from a database breach,they can quickly look up the hash in the rainbow table to find the original plaintext password 
#                 without having to perform computationally expensive hashing themselves.

#     The most effective defenses against these common password attacks are:-
#         1.  Strong, Unique Passwords/Passphrases: Long, random, and different for every account.
#         2.  Password Managers: To generate, store, and manage these passwords.
#         3.  Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Adds a critical second layer of security, making it exponentially harder for attackers to gain access even if they get your password.
#         4.  User Education: To recognize and avoid social engineering attacks like phishing.
#         5.  Robust Server-Side Defenses: Such as strong hashing, account lockout policies, and rate limiting.
